This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML where attempting to access a non-existent property of an element before it's fully parsed can lead to a silent failure.  The code attempts to set a non-existent property on a div element before the browser has finished rendering it.  This results in no error message, but the intended action doesn't occur.  The solution provides a corrected version using event listeners to ensure that the script executes after the element is ready.
